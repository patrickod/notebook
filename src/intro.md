### Introduction

Welcome to my lab notebook. This book aims to be a slightly more tidied up transcription of the ideas and thoughts that I regularly capture in paper form. Its purposes are twofold, to serve as a richer, searchable medium for my work notes but also to invite discussion and participation from others. If we share an interest in anything I've written about then please do reach out - I'd love to hear all about your adventures!

The idea for this notebook repository was heavily inspired by the previous work of [whitequark](https://twitter.com/whitequark) and [James Munns](https://twitter.com/bitshiftmask).
